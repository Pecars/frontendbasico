            <p> Soraya Montenegro was conceived by Mexican producer Valentin Pimstein as the antagonist of the first
                story arc of María la del Barrio, a remake of 1979 telenovela Los ricos también lloran. Soraya is
                loosely based on Esther Izaguirre, one of the villains of the old telenovela, but with considerable
                changes to her background, origin and mental state. Pimstein originally intended Soraya to die at the
                end of the first story arc. Nevertheless, he brought her back stating that Thalia needed a strong
                counterpart that could test her role as the heroine of the story.

            <p>Soraya Montenegro is the wealthy and evil niece of Victoria Montenegro de la Vega. She likes Luis
                Fernando and intends to get married with him, but he falls in love with María instead. Soraya manages to
                marry Luis Fernando by faking a pregnancy, but escapes when her lie is revealed. She tries to poison
                María and attempts to kill her accomplice before he turns her in, but falls from the apartment and is
                presumed dead.</p>

        <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>During her absence, María and Luis Fernando get married. María gives away her newborn son, Fernando,
                while suffering a mental disorder. She reunited with him, now nicknamed "Nandito", fourteen years later.
                It is revealed that Soraya had not died, and was taken to the United States for a long recovery. Soraya
                marries Oscar Montalban, and arranges a car accident to inherit his money. However, she must remain the
                stepmother of Oscar's daughter, the disabled Alicia, and keep her nanny Esperanza. Soraya moves back to
                Mexico to resume her vengeance plots against María and Luis Fernando, but falls in love with Nandito.
                Infuriated when Nandito falls in love with Alicia instead, she attacks him and Esperanza, leaving
                Nandito near death and causing Esperanza to suffer from amnesia. Soraya kills her mother Calixta and
                frames Nandito, but María takes the guilt and goes to prison. María is eventually declared innocent, but
                Soraya captures her and takes her to a wood cabin, with the intention to burn it down with María inside.
                María is rescued by Luis Fernando, but Soraya dies instead in the fire.</p>

        <div id="tabs-4">
            <p> Soraya Montenegro is remembered as an archetypical example of a telenovela villain, famous for her
                overactings and overreactions. She stayed popular in the 2000s as many of her scenes became internet
                memes, even among teenagers that never watched that soap opera. One of the most famous scenes is when
                she discovered Nandito kissing Alicia, and started to attack everyone.
            </p>

            <p> Itatí Cantoral played Soraya again in 2016, in a commercial for the fourth season of the Orange Is the
                New Black series. She appears as an inmate of the prison, mistreating the other inmates. The
                character was modified to fit the tone of the series, and became a convicted murderer. It was rumored
                that Cantoral would appear in commercials for further series in Netflix, but she denied those rumors.
            </p>


            <p> Actress Daniela Luján played Soraya in a recreation of the scene where she attacks Nandito, Alicia and
                Esperanza, at the TV program Verdad o reto. Itatí Cantoral was present in the audience, and praised
                Luján's work.
